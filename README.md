## Pok√©Dex Lite: <a target="_blank" href="https://pokedexlookup.netlify.app">Visit Demo Here (Work In Progress!)</a> 

This simple project was made to teach myself async/await, try/catch with the Pokemon API by <a target="_blank" href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI.co</a>.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 

## Optimizations

This project is still a work in progress. In the future, I will optimize and clean-up the JavaScript. The 'try' in the async function looks very heavy, and I will figure out how to address that as I learn more. <br />
In the future, I'd like to use either Svelte or React for this project and get more practice in with those libraries.

## Lessons Learned:

Still learning! Project is still in progress, I will update this section at a later time!
