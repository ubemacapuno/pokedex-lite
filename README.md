## PokéDex Lite: <a target="_blank" href="https://pokedexlookup.netlify.app">Visit Demo Here (Work In Progress!)</a> 

This simple project was made to teach myself how to use promises, async/await, and try/catch with the Pokémon API by <a target="_blank" href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokéAPI.co</a>.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API by PokéAPI.co. 
You can also view an interactive demo version <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/corey-damocles/pen/rNJZQXB">here on my codepen.io</a>!

## Optimizations:
In the future, I'd like to use either Svelte or React and get more practice in with those libraries. Also figure out a way to have everything display once everything has loaded; currently, it seems like the image rendering lags behind when the text renders.

## Lessons Learned:
I have used callbacks in the past when incorporating API calls; after building this application, I learned that using promises is just as effective and looks cleaner than callbacks (ex: the infamous "Callback Hell" pyramid). This project is still in progress, I will plan to update this section again after I've made changes.
