## Pok√©Dex Lite: <a target="_blank" href="https://pokedexlookup.netlify.app">Visit Demo Here (Work In Progress!)</a> 

This repository is to track my solutions to Codewars problems. I strive to push at minimum 5 coding challenges a week to this repo. I have the problems and solutions broken up into individual files, and organized into their respective folders by Kyu-level. Prior to writing out some of my solutions, I use the PREP method, in which I write out the <strong>Parameters</strong> of the problem, the <strong>Return</strong> for the solution, <strong>Examples</strong>/test cases, and my <strong>Pseudocode</strong> that outlines my thought process for the solution.

This simple project was made to help teach myself how to use async/await, try/catch with the Pokemon <a target="_blank" href="https://pokeapi.co/">pokeapi</a>.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 

## Optimizations

This project is still a work in progress. In the future, I will optimize and clean-up the JavaScript. The 'try' in the async function looks very heavy, and I will figure out how to address that as I learn more. <br />
In the future, I'd like to use either Svelte or React for this project and get more practice in with those libraries.

## Lessons Learned:

Still learning! Project is still in progress, I will update this section at a later time!
